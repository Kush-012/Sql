A-atomicity
C-consistent
I-isolation
D-durability

Atomicity:
=> all or none 
=> Either the transaction occurs completely or it does not occur at all.
=> operations either get abort or commit

Consistent:
=> database remains consistent before and after the transaction
=> A has 500 B has 200 total=700
=> A gives 100 to B
=> A=400 and B=300 total=700

Isolation:
=> means separation
=> Isolation ensures that multiple transactions occur 
independently and the intermediate results of a 
transaction are not visible to other transactions 
until it is committed.
=> multiple transactions occur independently
=> prevent dirty read (reading of uncommited data)

Durability:
=> permanent of something
=> means after commit data written on the disk
