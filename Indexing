Indexing is a technique used to speed up data retrieval by reducing the number of disk I/O operations.

An index is a type of data structure that stores:

Search Key	Data Reference
Key value	Pointer to disk block / record

Why Indexing?
Faster SELECT queries
Reduces disk access
Improves query performance

Indexing Methods
1. Primary Index (Clustering Index)
2. Secondary Index (Non-Clustering Index)

1️⃣ Primary Indexing (Clustering Index)

A primary index is created when the data file is sorted on the search key.
The index order is the same as the data file order.

Data is stored sequentially on disk.

Dense vs Sparse Index in Primary Index
🔹 Dense Index

Index entry for every search key value

More space required

Search Key → Record Pointer
1          → R1
2          → R2
3          → R3

🔹 Sparse Index

Index entry for some search key values

Usually one entry per data block

Less space required

Search Key → Block Pointer
1          → B1
11         → B2
21         → B3

Primary Index Based On Attribute Type
✅ Based on Key Attribute (Sparse Index)

Data file sorted on primary key

Index has one entry per block

Search Key   Block No
1            1
11           2
21           3
9991         1000

✅ Based on Non-Key Attribute (Dense Index)

Data file sorted on non-key attribute

Repeated values allowed

Index entry for each unique value

Dept ID   Block Pointer
1         B1
2         B1
3         B2
          B3


2️⃣ Secondary Indexing (Non-Clustering Index)

A secondary index is created when the data file is NOT sorted on the search key.
It provides an extra access path to data.

Search Key → Block Pointer
1          → B1
2          → B3
3          → B2


Search keys in index are sorted,
Data file blocks are not sorted.

Disk File Example
Block B1:
1
19
23

Block B2:
3
19
23

Block B3:
2
25
30

Secondary Index with Repeated Values

For non-key attributes, multiple records can have the same search key.

Search Key → Pointer List
1          → B1 → B2
2          → B3


Pointers are stored using a linked list.



Primary Index → Data sorted → fewer index entries

Secondary Index → Data unsorted → index entry for every record
