Normalization is the process of organising the data and the attributes of database.
minimising the redundancy

Normal Forms:
  1NF
  2NF
  3NF
  BCNF

1NF=>
Each table contain atomic value
Each record should be unique


2NF=>
Each table 1NF
table should not have partial dependency

score_id | student_id | subject_id | marks | teacher
1          10             1          70      Java
2          10             2          75      Cpp
3          11             1          80      Java

Primary Key: student_id+subject_id 
Candidate Key: score_id, student_id+subject_id 
Super Keys: All attribute sets that contain either score_id or (student_id, subject_id)

teacher depends only on subject_id          partial dependency
marks depend on student_id and subject_id   full dependency

it has partial dependency bcz teacher depends only on subject_id not on both 


3NF=>
be in 2 NF
table not have transitive dependency(A->B B->C then A!>C) on candidate key.   (non prime->non prime)
 

| St_Id | Name  | Sub_Id | Sub  | Address |
| ----: | ----- | -----: | ---- | ------- |
|     1 | John  |     11 | SQL  | Delhi   |
|     2 | Harry |     12 | C++  | Pune    |
|     3 | Sam   |     13 | JAVA | Delhi   |
|     4 | Rita  |     12 | C++  | Mumbai  |

St_Id → Sub_Id
Sub_Id → Sub
St_Id → Sub   (indirectly)

Transitive dependency
It should not be there

BCNF=>
